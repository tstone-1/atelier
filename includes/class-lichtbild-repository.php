 * an un-migrated one — or a rolled-back one — falls back to converting `_eg_gallery_data` on
 * the fly. Which of those applies is the `$owns_data` question, and getting it wrong is not a
 * detail: see `build_gallery()` for the two sources of truth that answer differs between.
 *
 * It once claimed to be the only class that knew Envira's storage layout, and that stopped
 * being true the day the schema move it predicted actually happened. `Lichtbild_Config`,
 * `Lichtbild_Album_Config` and `Lichtbild_Migration::build_record()` all know that layout now, and
 * deliberately: conversion is where the four spellings of true and the frozen titles are dealt
 * with once, rather than re-derived on every page load.

	 * renderer is handed one to resolve album members, and the AJAX and standalone handlers
	 * are constructed with one.
	 *
	 * **Two independent gates, and neither stands in for the other.** A password-protected
	 * post is `publish` status, so the status check alone lets it through; a draft gallery
	 * carries no password, so the password check alone lets *it* through. Both legs have a
	 * mutation apiece for that reason.
	 *
	 * Neither gate is enforced anywhere upstream for the content Lichtbild publishes. WordPress
	 * applies a post password by replacing `post_content`, and a gallery keeps its images in
	 * post meta; `Lichtbild_Repository::resolve_id()` matches a numeric ID on post *type* alone,
	 * so a draft or private gallery named by an album or a shortcode loads perfectly happily.
	 *
	 * **All five publishing paths consult this** — the standalone filter, both AJAX endpoints,
	 * the album cover grid, the shortcode, and the two blocks. The shortcode was the last to
	 * adopt it, and the argument for leaving it out was not a bad one; see the class docblock on
	 * `Lichtbild_Shortcode` for what settled it. The blocks arrived already consulting it, because
	 * they render nothing themselves and hand to the shortcode instead — which is the cheapest
	 * way to add a publishing path that cannot forget. Nothing here is optional, and a path that
	 * stops asking is the defect this predicate exists to make impossible to reintroduce quietly.
