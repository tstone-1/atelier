"""Prints the per-gallery custom CSS a site still has, ready to paste into the Customizer.

    uv run --with pymysql --with phpserialize python tools/export-custom-css.py > custom.css

Lichtbild stored a free-text CSS block per gallery through 26.8.21 and printed it in an inline
`<style>` element. 26.8.22 removed that: the wordpress.org guidelines do not permit a plugin to
store and emit arbitrary CSS entered through its own UI. This is how the CSS comes back out --
rewritten onto the ids it will need, one commented block per gallery, for
**Appearance -> Customize -> Additional CSS**.

It is lossless because the element ids do not move: a gallery is `#lichtbild-<id>` and its wrapper
`#lichtbild-<id>-wrap` whether the rule arrives inline from a plugin or from the Customizer. Only
the delivery changes.

**THERE ARE TWO PLACES THE CSS CAN BE, and reading only the obvious one silently returns a stale
value.** A migrated site keeps Envira's `_eg_gallery_data` untouched -- which is what makes the
migration reversible -- but the record Lichtbild actually *renders* from is `_lichtbild_gallery`, and
Lichtbild's own editor wrote CSS into that one. So a gallery whose CSS was edited through Lichtbild
after the migration has the current value in the v2 record and a pre-migration value in Envira's.
Reading Envira's alone would hand back the older text while reporting success.

**Run this before saving any gallery under 26.8.22.** A save rewrites the v2 record through the
new allowlist, which has no `custom_css` -- so the value in the v2 record is dropped at that
point. Envira's copy survives regardless; the v2 copy does not.

Exit status is 1 when any gallery's two copies disagree, so a caller cannot treat a conflicted
export as a clean one.

    `#envira-gallery-`, so applying the general rule first consumes the wrapper form and produces
    `#lichtbild-wrap-12`, which matches nothing -- the renderer emits `id="lichtbild-12-wrap"`. That
    exact bug shipped for months once; it is not hypothetical.

    Applied ONLY to Envira's copy. The v2 record was written either by the conversion, which had
    already applied this, or by hand in Lichtbild's editor against Lichtbild's own ids. Rewriting it
