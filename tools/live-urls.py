"""Prints every URL the plugin owns on the live site, one per line.

    uv run --with pymysql python tools/live-urls.py > urls.txt

The list comes from the database rather than from memory, and that is the entire point. The
first live deploy captured ten probe URLs chosen by hand, not one of which was an album -- and
the album page was the thing that broke, which stayed broken in production until a local
comparison found it. Enumerating from the schema means the surface cannot quietly shrink to
whatever came to mind.

What it covers, and why each is here:

- every published gallery permalink        -- the canonical, indexed URLs
- every published album permalink          -- the space that was forgotten once
- every image-tag archive                  -- the third registered URL space
- the protected gallery                    -- a control: it must keep answering with its form
- every post embedding a gallery shortcode -- the shortcode path, which the permalinks miss

Non-public galleries are deliberately excluded: they 404 for an anonymous fetch, so including
them would put four guaranteed non-200s in every capture and train the reader to skim past the
count that matters.

# The front page, which none of the queries above can reach and which every deploy from 26.8.1
# to 26.8.14 therefore verified nothing about. On timo-stein.com it is the blog index: it renders
# the latest posts' content in full, so it draws TEN galleries and 132 figures -- more gallery
# markup than any single permalink on the site, on its most-visited URL.
#
# It is invisible to all three queries by construction. It is not a gallery or album permalink,
# not a tag archive, and not a post whose own `post_content` holds a shortcode -- the shortcodes
# are in the posts it aggregates, each of which IS enumerated, which is exactly why the gap
# survived: the content was covered, so nothing looked wrong.
#
# Found by checking after a deploy whether a page with no gallery loads no assets, picking the
# home page as the example, and getting the opposite answer. Same lesson as 26.8.2, where ten
# probe URLs contained no album and the album regression reached production: enumerate the URL
# *spaces* a plugin can appear in, not a sample of the ones you thought of.
#
# Deliberately last so the count reads as "the enumerated surface plus the front page".
