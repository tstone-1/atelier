# The suite is a plain PHP program with no WordPress and no database, so running it across
# versions costs nothing but wall clock — which makes it the cheapest possible check on the
# one thing a single-version run cannot see: whether the plugin's own code is valid and
# behaves identically on the interpreter the live site actually uses.
#
# That matters here because the versions do not line up. This machine ships PHP 8.5;
# timo-stein.com runs 8.2. Every result until this script existed was measured on an
# interpreter the site does not have, which is the same family of mistake as benchmarking a
# debug build: not wrong so much as answering a question nobody asked.
#
# Only versions actually installed are run, and the script says which it skipped rather than
# quietly covering less than it appears to. A version that is absent is not a pass.
