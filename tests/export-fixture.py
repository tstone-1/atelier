"""Export a render fixture from a live WordPress database.

    uv run --with pymysql --with phpserialize python tests/export-fixture.py

Reads connection details from tests/.db.json (gitignored), which looks like:

    {"host": "…", "DB_NAME": "…", "DB_USER": "…", "DB_PASSWORD": "…", "PREFIX": "wp_"}

Those values live in the site's wp-config.php, with one exception that will otherwise waste
an afternoon: "host" is NOT wp-config.php's DB_HOST. That says "localhost", which is true
from the web server and useless from here. The database is reachable from outside on the
hosting account's own name, so "host" has to be set to that; DB_HOST is ignored if present. The output, tests/fixture.json, holds the
site's own gallery content and is gitignored for that reason — regenerate it rather than
sharing it.

Serialized blobs are carried as base64 so PHP's unserialize() sees the exact bytes MySQL
stored. Decoding them to text and re-encoding would corrupt any string whose byte length
prefix disagrees with its character count, which is the usual outcome of a utf8mb4
conversion somewhere in the site's history.
